Printing Column or Field

You can instruct AWK to print only certain columns from the input field. The following example demonstrates this âˆ’

awk '{print $3 "\t" $4}' marks.txt

Printing All Lines

By default, AWK prints all the lines that match pattern.
Example

awk '/a/ {print $0}' marks.txt

Printing Columns by Pattern

When a pattern match succeeds, AWK prints the entire record by default. But you can instruct AWK to print only certain fields. For instance, the following example prints the third and fourth field when a pattern match succeeds.
Example

awk '/a/ {print $3 "\t" $4}' marks.txt
