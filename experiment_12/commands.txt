curl

curl is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the supported protocols (DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP). The command is designed to work without user interaction.

curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authentication, FTP upload, HTTP post, SSL connections, cookies, file transfer resume, Metalink, and more. As you will see below, the number of features will make your head spin!

curl is powered by libcurl for all transfer-related features. See libcurl(3) for details.

open ftp.example.com

Send and receive a file in FTP

To get files from the server onto your own computer, use the get command as shown in the example below. In this example, you would get the file myfile.htm.

To send a file from your computer to the computer you are connected to, assuming you have the rights, use the send command as shown in the example below. In this example, we are sending the myfile.htm to the current directory.

ssh

Using the command-line

All modern Unix-like systems (Linux, OS X, BSDs, and others) include a command-line ssh client. To login to your computer from a Unix-like machine, go to a command-line and type:

ssh <username>@<computer name or IP address>

For example:

ssh joe@laptop

5)
grep

How do I use grep command to search a file?

Search /etc/passwd file for boo user, enter:
$ grep boo /etc/passwd

You can force grep to ignore word case i.e match boo, Boo, BOO and all other combination with the -i option:
$ grep -i "boo" /etc/passwd

Use grep recursively

You can search recursively i.e. read all files under each directory for a string “192.168.1.5”
$ grep -r "192.168.1.5" /etc/
