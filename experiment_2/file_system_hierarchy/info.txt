Like UNIX, Linux chooses to have a single hierarchical directory structure. Everything starts from the root directory, represented by /, and then expands into sub-directories instead of having so-called 'drives'. In the Windows environment, one may put one's files almost anywhere: on C drive, D drive, E drive etc. Such a file system is called a hierarchical structure and is managed by the programs themselves (program directories), not by the operating system. On the other hand, Linux sorts directories descending from the root directory / according to their importance to the boot process. 

The Root Directory
To comply with the FSSTND the following directories, or symbolic links to directories, are required in /. 
       /bin       Essential command binaries
       /boot      Static files of the boot loader
       /dev       Device files
       /etc       Host-specific system configuration
       /lib       Essential shared libraries and kernel modules
       /media     Mount point for removeable media
       /mnt       Mount point for mounting a filesystem temporarily
       /opt       Add-on application software packages
       /sbin      Essential system binaries
       /srv       Data for services provided by this system
       /tmp       Temporary files
       /usr       Secondary hierarchy
       /var       Variable data

The following directories, or symbolic links to directories, must be in /, if the corresponding subsystem is installed:


     / -- the root directory
     /home User home directories (optional)
     /lib<qual> Alternate format essential shared libraries
                      (optional)
     /root Home directory for the root user (optional)
